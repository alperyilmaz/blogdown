  abstract = {Establishing the architecture of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) relies on
            chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing
            (ChIP-Seq) methods that provide genome-wide transcription factor binding
            sites (TFBSs). ChIP-Seq furnishes millions of short reads that, after
            alignment, describe the genome-wide binding sites of a particular TF.
            However, in all organisms investigated an average of 40\% of reads fail to
            align to the corresponding genome, with some datasets having as much as 80\%
            of reads failing to align. We describe here the provenance of previously
            unaligned reads in ChIP-Seq experiments from animals and plants. We show
            that a substantial portion corresponds to sequences of bacterial and
            metazoan origin, irrespective of the ChIP-Seq chromatin source. Unforeseen
            was the finding that 30\%-40\% of unaligned reads were actually alignable. To
            validate these observations, we investigated the characteristics of the
            previously unaligned reads corresponding to TAL1, a human TF involved in
            lineage specification of hemopoietic cells. We show that, while unmapped
            ChIP-Seq read datasets contain foreign DNA sequences, additional TFBSs can
            be identified from the previously unaligned ChIP-Seq reads. Our results
            indicate that the re-evaluation of previously unaligned reads from ChIP-Seq
            experiments will significantly contribute to TF target identification and
            determination of emerging properties of GRNs. },

  abstract = {Flavonoids constitute the largest class of dietary phytochemicals, adding
            essential health value to our diet, and are emerging as key nutraceuticals.
            Cellular targets for dietary phytochemicals remain largely unknown, posing
            significant challenges for the regulation of dietary supplements and the
            understanding of how nutraceuticals provide health value. Here, we describe
            the identification of human cellular targets of apigenin, a flavonoid
            abundantly present in fruits and vegetables, using an innovative
            high-throughput approach that combines phage display with second generation
            sequencing. The 160 identified high-confidence candidate apigenin targets
            are significantly enriched in three main functional categories: GTPase
            activation, membrane transport, and mRNA metabolism/alternative splicing.
            This last category includes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2
            (hnRNPA2), a factor involved in splicing regulation, mRNA stability, and
            mRNA transport. Apigenin binds to the C-terminal glycine-rich domain of
            hnRNPA2, preventing hnRNPA2 from forming homodimers, and therefore, it
            perturbs the alternative splicing of several human hnRNPA2 targets. Our
            results provide a framework to understand how dietary phytochemicals exert
            their actions by binding to many functionally diverse cellular targets. In
            turn, some of them may modulate the activity of a large number of
            downstream genes, which is exemplified here by the effects of apigenin on
            the alternative splicing activity of hnRNPA2. Hence, in contrast to
            small-molecule pharmaceuticals designed for defined target specificity,
            dietary phytochemicals affect a large number of cellular targets with
            varied affinities that, combined, result in their recognized health
            benefits.},

            P1 an important visual marker. Using genome-wide expression analyses (RNA

            combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput

            broader than the activation of genes corresponding to enzymes in a branch
            of flavonoid biosynthesis. P1 modulates the expression of several thousand
            genes, and ∼1500 of them were identified as putative direct targets of
            P1. Among them, we identified F2H1, corresponding to a P450 enzyme that
            converts naringenin into 2-hydroxynaringenin, a key branch point in the
            P1-controlled pathway and the first step in the formation of insecticidal
            C-glycosyl flavones. Unexpectedly, the binding of P1 to gene regulatory
            regions can result in both gene activation and repression. Our results
            indicate that P1 is the major regulator for a set of genes involved in
            flavonoid biosynthesis and a minor modulator of the expression of a much
            larger gene set that includes genes involved in primary metabolism and

  abstract = {Translation is a regulated process and is pivotal to proper cell growth and
            homeostasis. All retroviruses rely on the host translational machinery for
            viral protein synthesis and thus may be susceptible to its perturbation in
            response to stress, co-infection, and/or cell cycle arrest. HIV-1 infection
            arrests the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, potentially disrupting the
            regulation of host cell translation. In this study, we present evidence
            that HIV-1 infection downregulates translation in lymphocytes, attributable
            to the cell cycle arrest induced by the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr. The
            molecular basis of the translation suppression is reduced accumulation of
            the active form of the translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). However,
            synthesis of viral structural proteins is sustained despite the general
            suppression of protein production. HIV-1 mRNA translation is sustained due
            to the distinct composition of the HIV-1 ribonucleoprotein complexes.
            RNA-coimmunoprecipitation assays determined that the HIV-1 unspliced and
            singly spliced transcripts are predominantly associated with nuclear cap
            binding protein 80 (CBP80) in contrast to completely-spliced viral and
            cellular mRNAs that are associated with eIF4E. The active translation of
            the nuclear cap binding complex (CBC)-bound viral mRNAs is demonstrated by
            ribosomal RNA profile analyses. Thus, our findings have uncovered that the
            maintenance of CBC association is a novel mechanism used by HIV-1 to bypass
            downregulation of eIF4E activity and sustain viral protein synthesis. We
            speculate that a subset of CBP80-bound cellular mRNAs contribute to
            recovery from significant cellular stress, including human retrovirus
            infection.},

  abstract = {The control of gene expression is a biological process essential to all
            organisms. This is accomplished through the interaction of regulatory
            proteins with specific DNA motifs in the control regions of the genes that
            they regulate. Upon binding to DNA, and through specific protein-protein
            interactions, these regulatory proteins convey signals to the basal
            transcriptional machinery, containing the respective RNA polymerases,
            resulting in particular rates of gene expression. In eukaryotes, in
            addition and complementary to the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA,
            chromatin structure plays a role in modulating gene expression. Small RNAs
            are emerging as key components in this process. This chapter provides an
            introduction to some of the basic players participating in these processes,
            the transcription factors and co-regulators, the cis-regulatory elements
            that often function as transcription factor docking sites, and the emerging

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome sequences can be conceptualized as arrangements of
            motifs or words. The frequencies and positional distributions of these
            words within particular non-coding genomic segments provide important
            insights into how the words function in processes such as mRNA stability
            and regulation of gene expression. RESULTS: Using an enumerative word
            discovery approach, we investigated the frequencies and positional
            distributions of all 65,536 different 8-letter words in the genome of
            Arabidopsis thaliana. Focusing on promoter regions, introns, and 3' and 5'
            untranslated regions (3'UTRs and 5'UTRs), we compared word frequencies in
            these segments to genome-wide frequencies. The statistically interesting
            words in each segment were clustered with similar words to generate motif
            logos. We investigated whether words were clustered at particular locations
            or were distributed randomly within each genomic segment, and we classified
            the words using gene expression information from public repositories.
            Finally, we investigated whether particular sets of words appeared together
            more frequently than others. CONCLUSION: Our studies provide a detailed
            view of the word composition of several segments of the non-coding portion
            of the Arabidopsis genome. Each segment contains a unique word-based
            signature. The respective signatures consist of the sets of enriched words,
            'unwords', and word pairs within a segment, as well as the preferential
            locations and functional classifications for the signature words.
            Additionally, the positional distributions of enriched words within the
            segments highlight possible functional elements, and the co-associations of
            words in promoter regions likely represent the formation of higher order
            regulatory modules. This work is an important step toward fully cataloguing
            the functional elements of the Arabidopsis genome.},

            that integrates information on TFs and gene promoters across the grasses.
            In its initial implementation, GRASSIUS consists of two separate, yet
            linked, databases. GrassTFDB holds information on TFs from maize (Zea
            mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), and rice

  abstract = {Lymphoma is a malignant neoplasm arising from B or T lymphocytes. In dogs,
            one-third of lymphomas are highly aggressive multicentric T-cell lymphomas
            that are often associated with humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HHM).
            There are no cell lines or animal models to investigate the pathogenesis of
            T-cell lymphoma and HHM in dogs. We developed the first xenograft model by
            injecting lymphoma cells from an Irish Wolfhound intraperitoneally into
            NOD/SCID mice. The mice developed multicentric lymphoma along with HHM and
            increased parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) as occurs in dogs
            with T-cell lymphoma. Using cytokine complementary DNA arrays, we
            identified genes that have potential implications in the pathogenesis of
            T-cell lymphoma. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
            reaction (RT-PCR) of T-cell lymphoma samples from hypercalcaemic canine
            patients showed that PTHrP likely plays a central role in the pathogenesis
            of HHM and that hypercalcaemia is the result of a combinatorial effect of
            different hypercalcaemic factors. Finally, we monitored in vivo tumour
            progression and metastases in the mouse model by transducing the lymphoma
            cells with a lentiviral vector that encodes a luciferase-yellow fluorescent
            protein reporter and showed that in vivo trafficking patterns in this model
            were similar to those seen in dogs. This unique mouse model will be useful
            for translational research in lymphoma and for investigating the
            pathogenesis of T-cell lymphoma and HHM in the dog.},

            replication motifs that impose barriers to efficient ribosome scanning. Two
            RNA structural motifs that facilitate efficient translation initiation
            despite a complex 5' UTR are internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and 5'
            proximal post-transcriptional control element (PCE). Here, stringent RNA
            and protein analyses determined the 5' UTR of spleen necrosis virus (SNV),
            reticuloendotheliosis virus A (REV-A) and human T-cell leukemia virus type
            1 (HTLV-1) exhibit PCE activity, but not IRES activity. Assessment of SNV
            translation initiation in the natural context of the provirus determined
            that SNV is reliant on a cap-dependent initiation mechanism. Experiments
            with siRNAs identified that REV-A and HTLV-1 PCE modulate
            post-transcriptional gene expression through interaction with host RNA
            helicase A (RHA). Analysis of hybrid SNV/HTLV-1 proviruses determined SNV
            PCE facilitates Rex/Rex responsive element-independent Gag production and
            interaction with RHA is necessary. Ribosomal profile analyses determined
            that RHA is necessary for polysome association of HTLV-1 gag and provide
            direct evidence that RHA is necessary for efficient HTLV-1 replication. We
            conclude that PCE/RHA is an important translation regulatory axis of
            multiple lymphotropic retroviruses. We speculate divergent retroviruses
            have evolved a convergent RNA-protein interaction to modulate translation
            of their highly structured mRNA.},

abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Coordinate enhancement of transgene transcription and
            translation would be a potent approach to significantly improve protein
            output in a broad array of viral vectors and nonviral expression systems.
            Many vector transgenes are complementary DNA (cDNA). The lack of splicing
            can significantly reduce the efficiency of their translation. Some
            retroviruses contain a 5' terminal post-transcriptional control element
            (PCE) that facilitates translation of unspliced mRNA. Here we evaluated the
            potential for spleen necrosis virus PCE to stimulate protein production
            from HIV-1 based lentiviral vector by: 1) improving translation of the
            internal transgene transcript; and 2) functionally synergizing with a
            transcriptional enhancer to achieve coordinate increases in RNA synthesis
            and translation. RESULTS: Derivatives of HIV-1 SIN self-inactivating
            lentiviral vector were created that contain PCE and cytomegalovirus
            immediate early enhancer (CMV IE). Results from transfected cells and four
            different transduced cell types indicate that: 1) PCE enhanced transgene
            protein synthesis; 2) transcription from the internal promoter is enhanced
            by CMV IE; 3) PCE and CMV IE functioned synergistically to significantly
            increase transgene protein yield; 4) the magnitude of translation
            enhancement by PCE was similar in transfected and transduced cells; 5)
            differences were observed in steady state level of PCE vector RNA in
            transfected and transduced cells; 6) the lower steady state was not
            attributable to reduced RNA stability, but to lower cytoplasmic
            accumulation in transduced cells. CONCLUSION: PCE is a useful tool to
            improve post-transcriptional expression of lentiviral vector transgene.
            Coordinate enhancement of transcription and translation is conferred by the
            combination of PCE with CMV IE transcriptional enhancer and increased
            protein yield up to 11 to 17-fold in transfected cells. The incorporation
            of the vector provirus into chromatin correlated with reduced cytoplasmic
            accumulation of PCE transgene RNA. We speculate that epigenetic modulation
            of promoter activity altered cotranscriptional recruitment of RNA
            processing factors and reduced the availability of fully processed
            transcript or the efficiency of export from the nucleus. Our results
            provide an example of the dynamic interplay between the transcription and
            post-transcription steps of gene expression and document that introduction
            of heterologous gene expression signals can yield disparate effects in
            transfected versus transduced cells.},
