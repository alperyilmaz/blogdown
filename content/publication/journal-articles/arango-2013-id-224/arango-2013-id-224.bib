 abstract = {Flavonoids constitute the largest class of dietary phytochemicals, adding
essential health value to our diet, and are emerging as key nutraceuticals.
Cellular targets for dietary phytochemicals remain largely unknown, posing
significant challenges for the regulation of dietary supplements and the
understanding of how nutraceuticals provide health value. Here, we describe
the identification of human cellular targets of apigenin, a flavonoid
abundantly present in fruits and vegetables, using an innovative
high-throughput approach that combines phage display with second generation
sequencing. The 160 identified high-confidence candidate apigenin targets
are significantly enriched in three main functional categories: GTPase
activation, membrane transport, and mRNA metabolism/alternative splicing.
This last category includes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2
(hnRNPA2), a factor involved in splicing regulation, mRNA stability, and
mRNA transport. Apigenin binds to the C-terminal glycine-rich domain of
hnRNPA2, preventing hnRNPA2 from forming homodimers, and therefore, it
perturbs the alternative splicing of several human hnRNPA2 targets. Our
results provide a framework to understand how dietary phytochemicals exert
their actions by binding to many functionally diverse cellular targets. In
turn, some of them may modulate the activity of a large number of
downstream genes, which is exemplified here by the effects of apigenin on
the alternative splicing activity of hnRNPA2. Hence, in contrast to
small-molecule pharmaceuticals designed for defined target specificity,
dietary phytochemicals affect a large number of cellular targets with
varied affinities that, combined, result in their recognized health
benefits.},
