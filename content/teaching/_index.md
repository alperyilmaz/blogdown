**Final exam will cover topics discussed after Midterm exam.**

Number and content of assignments will be provided later. The assignments will be related to “applications of a given virus to bioengineering problems”. Midterm and Final results are announced at “AVESIS Announcements” page, if you think there’s mistake or problem with your score please contact the instructor in order to go over your exam results. At the end of the semester, all your exam scores and total score will be published along with letter ranges. If your total score is very close to boundary please contact the instructor and he would try to help in that matter. 

**Communication**

I’m trying to respond emails as quickly as possible. If you don’t get a response within 1-2 days please don’t hesitate to send a reminder email. The changes pertaining to exam date, time and assignment due dates should be decided in class after discussing with everybody. Please don’t ask for changes individually, otherwise notification of whole class becomes a hassle.
